# What's the Unkwon Type in TypeScript?

\`unkwon\` is a safety version of the \`any\` type. If you want to use a variable
type it as \`unknown\`, you first need to validate that the method you are trying
to call or the value you are trying to reassign is valid.

\`\`\`ts
let exampleUnkwon: unkwon;

exampleUnkwon = 123;
exampleUnkwon = "foo";

if (typeof exampleUnkwon == "string") {
  exampleUnkwon.trim();
}

if (typeof exampleUnkwon == "boolean") {
  let exampleSetBool: boolean = exampleUnkwon;
}
\`\`\`

> [!TIP]
>
> One of the best use of the type \`unkwon\` is to do a safety migration from >
> JavaScript to TypeScript.

# What Are Type Assertions in TypeScript?

Type Assertions is a way to say to the compiler that we know we are doing. That
is pretty much like a \`cast\` in other typed of language.

> [!DANGER]
>
> Type Assertions are very handy, but an ideal approach is to use proper Type >
> Annotations or Runtime JavaScript type checks instead.

\`\`\`ts
let hello = load();
const trimmed = (hello as string).trim();

# What Are Type Declarations in TypeScript?

A declaration file provides a way to declare the existence of some types or
values without actually providing implementations for those values.

# How to Create NPM Packages?

## ️⚙️Initialization

1. First, we are starting our project using the following \`tsc\` command:

\`\`\`bash
bunx tsc --init --rootDir src --outDir lib --sourceMap --declaration --declarationMap
\`\`\`

> [!HELP]

- \`--init\` to initialize the \`tsconfig.json\` file.
- \`--rootDir src\`, where our Source Code is going to live.
- \`--outDir lib\`, where our Compiled Code is going to end.
- \`--sourceMap\`, we enable source maps so we can debug the TypeScript Source
  Code from the generated JavaScript.
- \`--declaration\`, we enable declarations so the compiler generates Type
  Definitions which can be used by our TypeScript consumers.
- \`--declarationMap\`, we enable declaration map which allows our TypeScript
  consumers to navigate from the Type Definitions to the TypeScript source code.

2. Now it's time to modify some properties in the \`package.json\`.

- We are going to add or change the \`main\` property to \`lib\`.
- And we are going to add or change the \`types\` property to also \`lib\`.

## 📢 Publish

Using the command \`npm publish\`, it makes this package available for use for
anyone else through NPM.
